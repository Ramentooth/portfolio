### Calculator (2025)

When the program runs, a gray window appears with several blue buttons arranged in a row near the top. Each button has a label showing a math symbol—equals, plus, minus, multiply, and divide—and they lighten slightly when the mouse hovers over them. The interface looks like the beginning of a calculator’s control panel, clean and minimal, with space below for additional elements such as number buttons or a display screen. The output gives a clear visual impression of a calculator’s layout and interaction design.
