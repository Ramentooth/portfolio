## Projects for Term 1

### Calculator (2025)

When the program runs, a gray window appears with several blue buttons arranged in a row near the top. Each button has a label showing a math symbol—equals, plus, minus, multiply, and divide—and they lighten slightly when the mouse hovers over them. The interface looks like the beginning of a calculator’s control panel, clean and minimal, with space below for additional elements such as number buttons or a display screen. The output gives a clear visual impression of a calculator’s layout and interaction design.

### Computer History Timeline (2025)

This Processing program creates an interactive timeline called **“Historic Computer Systems”** that visually presents key milestones in computing history from 1936 to 2007. A horizontal timeline spans the screen, with events alternating above and below it, each shown as a labeled box representing important developments such as the Turing Machine, ENIAC, Macintosh, and iPhone. When the user hovers over an event, a brief description appears explaining its historical significance. The project demonstrates effective use of functions, mouse interaction, and visual layout to clearly communicate how computer technology has evolved over time.

### Grade Calculator (2025)

This Processing program is a simple graphics and logic assignment that simulates assigning letter grades based on a randomly generated numeric GPA value. The sketch draws a horizontal line with a small circle that follows the mouse along the line and displays the mouse’s x-position, while also showing a “Grade:” label on the screen. Each frame, the program generates a random grade between 0.0 and 4.0 and uses a series of conditional statements to determine and print the corresponding letter grade (from A to F) in the console. The project demonstrates basic use of graphics, mouse interaction, random number generation, variables, and if-else decision structures in Processing.

### Making Cars (2025)

This Processing program demonstrates object-oriented programming by creating and animating multiple car objects on the screen. A custom Car class is defined with attributes such as color, position, speed, and direction, and includes methods to display and move each car. In setup(), an array of cars is initialized with random colors, positions, speeds, and directions. In draw(), the background is refreshed and each car is displayed and moved across the screen, wrapping around when it reaches the edge. The project shows how classes, constructors, arrays, and methods can be used together to manage and animate many objects efficiently.

### MusikHelfer (2025)

This Proccesing program runs an all in one music helper which includes a tuner, Interval ear training, Harmonizer, and a metranome.
